# Description  
In this file you will find every function that i used to test the theory behind image analysis. Given the importance of such, i was sure that i had to document it somehow. This is where this README comes to play, down below i describe what every function is doing and how (note that the *why* is answered in the theory file).

- [Image's functions](#Image)

- [Adjacency's functions](#Adjacency)

- [MathMorph's functions](#MathMorph)

- [Kernel's functions](#Kernel)

# Common
These funcions are common to all library, mainly used as a aux for the others, or to myself. 

## applylog
This one is pretty straightforward, is a mathamatical way of doing a log of a number, given certain base, using natural log. This one will come in hand when we work with bit depth.
