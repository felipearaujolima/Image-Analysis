The main goal of this repo is to create a easy way to understand the core concepts of image analysis. Here, you will find the theory behind it all plus the hands on of it. Keep in mind that will be errors and some small mistakes here and there, however, i will do my best to keep then as minimal as possible.   
Everything that is presented here was taught to me by professor Alexandre Falcao, in Unicamp - Brazil. The link to his homepage will be on the end of this readme.  

The structure of this repository is 


Github repository for the image analysis course given by Alexandre Falcao at Unicamp. Here, you will find: 
* Fundamentals of Image Processing 
* Image Filtering by connected operators
* Graph-based image segmentation
* Introduction to image representation
* Region-based image representation
* Shape-based image representation 
* Introduction to image description
* Histogram of gradients
* Bag of visual words
* Convolutional Neural Networks, Segmentation, and Classification
* Classification by Optimum-Path Forest

The main aspect of this repository is its focus on working with C. Although much of what is seen here can be found in Python, I think it's important to understand the main concepts and the internal implementation of what we use and see every day.
