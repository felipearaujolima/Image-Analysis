<h1 align="center"> Image Analysis Course </h1>

Github repository for the image analysis course given by Alexandre Falcao at Unicamp. Here, you will find: 
* Fundamentals of Image Processing 
* Image Filtering by connected operators
* Graph-based image segmentation
* Introduction to image representation
* Region-based image representation
* Shape-based image representation 
* Introduction to image description
* Histogram of gradients
* Bag of visual words
* Convolutional Neural Networks, Segmentation, and Classification
* Classification by Optimum-Path Forest

The main aspect of this repository is its focus on working with C. Although much of what is seen here can be found in Python, I think it's important to understand the main concepts and the internal implementation of what we use and see every day.
